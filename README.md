exoplanet detection
=========

This project mainly focused in classifying kepler objects http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/ETSS/Kepler_index.html as exoplanet or not.

Using Support Vector Machines we classify them as false positive or confirm.GPU computing is the heart of the project as it involves a large data bse of 40 GB we mainly used RPUSVM written in R and uses GPU to classify using SVM model.

The code is written using R,python,JQuery,C,Java and shell scripts.
